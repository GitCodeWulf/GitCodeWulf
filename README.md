- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitCodeWulf
- 👀 My interests : Building Next Gen, Secure and robust Software; Something difficult to break for QEs :-)! I love exploring Anti-Architecture Patterns to challenge the obvious here! I enjoy Ethical hacking, DevSecOps, GenAI, AI/ML, Neural networks, Tensor, PyTorch, Keras, LLM evaluations, coding agent evaluations etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about and exploring google's tools that help translate Mainframe/CICS-batches to be translated into Java/Springboot Services. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything NEXT GEN that saves time and cost for large teams with a product in making and is scheduled for a  Go to market in future against competition, it could be for Fintechs/Insurance or Health domains.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am enjoying  National Geographic exploring Wolves! My admiration for their loyalities to their partner and parents, honesty of (hunting/)working hard to earn food and not using shortcuts of living off carcasses is now manyfold. It is motivational to adopt some of these features in our character.
